# Properties

When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance (object) of the data type. Instances can have additional information (properties) attached to them. For example, every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters. You can retrieve property information by using dot notation on the instance:

```javascript
console.log('Hello'.length);  // outputs 5
```

Note that the length of a string is calculated when the instance is created.
