# Requests


JavaScript is an asynchronous language. It uses an [event loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop) to handle asynchronous function calls. When a program is run, function calls are made and added to a stack. The functions that make requests that need to wait for servers to respond get sent to a separate queue. Once the stack has cleared, then the functions in the queue are executed one at a time.

## Example

To get a glimpse of how the event loop works the following example uses the setTimeout(), which will pass a function call to the queue. The first argument is a callback and the second argument is the number of milliseconds the program must wait before the callback can be run. The other console.log() calls are run from the stack.

```javascript
console.log('First');
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Last');
}, 0);
console.log('Second');
// First
// Second
// Last
```

Web developers use the event loop to create a smoother browsing experience by deciding when to call functions and how to handle asynchronous events. One set of tools for this is AJAX *(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)*. AJAX enables requests to be made after the initial page load.


## XMLHttpRequest GET

The XMLHttpRequest (XHR) API, can be used to make many kinds of requests and supports other forms of data. All modern browsers have a built-in XMLHttpRequest object to request data from a server. Here's an example of boilerplate code for an AJAX request using an XHR object:

```javascript
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
const url = 'https://api-to-call.com/endpoint';

xhr.responseType = 'json';
xhr.onreadystatechange = () => {
  // checks to see of the request has finished
  if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
    return xhr.response;
  }
};

xhr.open('GET', url);
xhr.send();
```

A query string contains additional information to be sent with a request. A query string is separated from the URL using a `?` character. After `?`, you can create a parameter which is a key/value pair joined by `=`. For example:

`https://api.datamuse.com/words?key=value`

If you want to add additional parameters, use the `&` character to separate key/value pairs:

`https://api.datamuse.com/words?key1=value1&key2=value2`


## XMLHttpRequest POST

The major difference between a GET request and POST request is that a POST request requires additional information to be sent through with the request. This additional information is sent in the body of the post request.

```javascript
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
const url = 'https://api-to-call.com/endpoint';
// converts data to a string:
const data = JSON.stringify({id: '200'});

xhr.responseType = 'json';
xhr.onreadystatechange = () => {
  // checks to see of the request has finished
  if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
    return xhr.response;
  }
};

xhr.open('POST', url);
xhr.send(data);
```

In short, writing GET and POST requests with XHR objects and vanilla JavaScript requires constructing the XHR object using new, setting the responseType, creating a function that will handle the response object, and opening and sending the request.

Determining how to correctly write the actual requests and how to properly implement them requires carefully reading the documentation of the API with which you're working.


## ES6 Requests (Promises)

To make asynchronous event handling easier, [promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) were introduced in JavaScript in ES6. A promise is a JavaScript object that handles asynchronous data. They represent data that will eventually be returned from a request. A promise has three states:

- *pending:* when a promise is created or waiting for data.
- *fulfilled:* the asynchronous operation was handled successfully.
- *rejected:* the asynchronous operation was unsuccessful.


### GET with fetch()

`fetch()` is a web API that can be used to create requests. The `fetch()` function:
1. creates a request object that contains relevant information that an API needs.
2. sends that request object to the API endpoint provided.
3. returns a promise that ultimately resolves to a response object, which contains the status of the promise with information the API sent back.

```javascript
fetch('https://api-to-call.com/endpoint').then(response => {
  if (response.ok) {
      return response.json();
  }
  else {
      throw new Error('Request failed!');
  }
}, networkError => { console.log(networkError.message); }
).then(jsonResponse => {
    return jsonResponse;
});
```

`.then()` will fire only after the promise status of `fetch()` has been resolved. the first argument passed to `then()` is a success callback which takes one parameter: `response`. The second argument passed to `then()` is a function that will handle any failures. This second function also takes a single paramter: `networkError`.

The second `.then()'`s success callback wonâ€™t run until the previous `.then()` method has finished running. It will also not run if there was an error thrown.


### POST with fetch()

The main difference with POST requests with `fetch()`, is that the initial call takes two arguments: an endpoint and an object that contains information for the POST request. The rest of the request is identical to the GET request.

```javascript
fetch('https://api-to-call.com/endpoint', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({id: '200'})
}).then(response => {
  if (response.ok) {
      return response.json();
  }
  else {
      throw new Error('Request failed!');
  }
}, networkError => { console.log(networkError.message); }
).then(jsonResponse => {
    return jsonResponse;
});
```


## ES8 async/await GET requests

This type of GET request uses the new `async` and `await` keywords.

Some key points:

- an `async` function  will return a promise.
- `await` can only be used in an `async` function. `await` allows a program to run (continue moving through the message queue) while waiting for a promise to resolve .
- In a `try...catch` statement, code in the try block will be run and in the event of an exception/error, the code in the catch statement will run.


```javascript
const getData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api-to-call.com/endpoint');
    if (response.ok) {
      // Since .json() is an asynchronous method we have to await
      // until the promise status is resolved.
      const jsonResponse = await response.json();
      return jsonResponse;
    }
    else {
        throw new Error('Request failed!');
    }
  }
  catch(error) {
    console.log(error);
    // Generally, you would create a more sophisticated way of
    // handling the error, like redirecting users to another page.
  }
};
```


## ES8 async/await POST requests

As with the above POST with `fetch()` example, the main difference here between GET and POST is that we have to pass the second argument to `fetch()`.

```javascript
const getData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api-to-call.com/endpoint', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({id: '200'})
    });
    if (response.ok) {
      const jsonResponse = await response.json();
      return jsonResponse;
    }
    else {
        throw new Error('Request failed!');
    }
  }
  catch(error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};
```


## Summary

GET and POST requests can be created a variety of ways. `fetch()` and `async`/`await` are new functionalities developed in ES6 (promises) and ES8 respectively.
