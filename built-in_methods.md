# Built-in Methods

The console.log() command is used to print, or log, text to the console.

```javascript
console.log("Hello!");
document.writeln("Hello, hello.")
```

Like properties, built-in methods are called by appending an instance with a period, the name of the method followed by parentheses(). While properties are calculated when an instance is created, built-in methods perform actions that generate an output when they are called on an instance.

```javascript
console.log('Hello'.toUpperCase());  // 'HELLO'
console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H'));  // true
```
