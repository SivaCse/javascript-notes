# Built-in Methods

JavaScript has built-in methods for different data types.

Like properties, built-in methods are called by appending an instance with a period, the name of the method followed by parentheses`()`. While properties are calculated when an instance is created, built-in methods perform actions that generate output when they are called on an instance.

```javascript
console.log('Hello'.toUpperCase());  // 'HELLO'
console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H'));  // true
```
