# jQuery


While the [necessity of jQuery is waning](https://flaviocopes.com/jquery/) in favour vanilla CSS and ES6 vanilla js, it's still good to know being that [it's currently used in millions of websites](https://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery). They key benefits/features of jQuery include simple access to elements using css-like selectors, methods that let you update the DOM, animate and loop, attach event listeners.

## Including jQuery

In your HTML, you'll need to link to jQuery. [Select a download here](https://jquery.com/download/) or [select a CDN here](https://code.jquery.com/). Make sure link to the jQuery comes **before** any of your own scripts that use it.

```html
<!-- download -->
<script src="js/jquery-3.4.1.min.js" defer></script>

<!-- cdn -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-CSXorXvZcTkaix6Yvo6HppcZGetbYMGWSFlBw8HfCJo=" crossorigin="anonymous" defer></script>
```


## Selecting elements

jQuery has a function `jQuery()` that is usually written as shorthand `$()`. This function takes one parameter, a css-style selector, and returns a jQuery object (also known as a *matched set* or *jquery selection*) containing all the elements matched by the selector. The main advantage of this over `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll`, is that these two methods may not work in older browsers but jQuery has some fallback code built-in.

note: When assigning a jQuery object to a variable, many give it a name starting with `$` to differentiate it from other variables in your scripts.

```javascript
// selects all headings with class="primary-heading":
$('h1.primary-heading')

// selects all uls that contain at least one li with class="high-priority":
$('ul:has(li.high-priority)')

// assigns an element with id="js-message-box" to a variable $message:Ã¥
const $message = $('#js-message-box');
```

## Applying methods

You can use jQuery methods to manipulate the DOM, update elements and add event listeners. These methods can, of course, be chained.

```javascript
$('h1.primary-heading').addClass('highlight');

$('#special').hide().delay(500).fadeIn(1200);

$('li.todo').on('click', function () {
    $(this).remove();
})
```

One key difference between this and vanilla JS, is that the methods can affect all the selected elements without the need to loop through each one. That being said, *some* methods, when being used to retrieve information from an element, will only return the information for the first element if your jQuery selection includes more than one. If you needed to get information from a different one, you could use another method to traverse or filter the selection. If you needed to get information from all elements you could use the `.each()` method. For example:

```html
<ul>
  <li><em>one</em></li>
  <li>two</li>
  <li>three</li>
  <li>four</li>
</ul>
```

```javascript
// getting information:
$('li').text();  // returns information from all li => 'onetwothreefour'
$('li').html();  // returns information from the first li => '<em>one</em>'

// setting information:
$('li').text('hey');           // changes the text content of all li
$('li').html('<em>hey</em>');  // changes the html content of all li
```


### Methods for modifying
method                | description
------                | -----------
`.html()`             | gets the html content of the first element in the selection or sets the html content of all elements in the selection.
`.text()`             | gets or sets the text content of all elements in the selection
`.replaceWith()`      | replaces all the elements in the selection with the new html content and returns the replaced elements as an object
`.remove()`           | removes all of the elements in the selection
`.before()`           | inserts the html content before each element in the selection
`.after()`            | inserts the html content after each element in the selection
`.prepend()`          | prepends the html content to the beginning of each element (inside the opening tag) in the selection
`.append()`           | appends the html content to the end of each element (inside the closing tag) in the selection
`.clone()`            | creates a copy of the matched set, including all their descendants. Note that id names will be copied too. If you want to copy any event handlers as well, pass `true` to the clone method.
`.unwrap()`           | removes parents of the matched set
`.detach()`           | works the same as remove but retains event handlers and any other associated jQuery data so that they can be inserted back into the page.
`.empty()`            | removes all child nodes and descendants
`.add()`              | can be used to add a selection to another selection
`.attr()`             | gets or sets a specified attribute and its value e.g. `$('a.author').attr('href');` would retrieve the href value and `$('a.author').attr('href', 'https://jquery.com/');` would set the href value. When setting, if the attribute does not already exist, it will be created.
`.removeAttr()`       | removes the specified attribute of each element
`.addClass()`         | adds a class to each element
`.removeClass()`      | removes a class from each element
`.css()`              | retrieves and sets values of css properties
`.val()`              | retrieves content from `<input>` and `<textarea>`
`.isNumeric()`        | checks whether the value represents a numeric value and returns a boolean. It's a global method so it's not used on a jQuery selection, but rather the value is passed e.g. `&.isNumeric(0xff)`


### Methods for finding & selecting
Note that many of these methods do not require a selector argument, but if passed will include that in the match, for example: `$('ul').children();` will fins all the child elements of `ul` and `$('ul').children('.important');` will find only the child elements with class important.

method                | description
------                | -----------
`.find()`             | all elements in current selection that match given selector
`.closest()`          | nearest ancestor (not just parent) that matches the given selector
`.parent()`           | direct parent of the current selection
`.parents()`          | all parents (grandparents etc) of the current selection
`.children()`         | all children of the current selection
`.siblings()`         | all siblings of the current selection
`.next()`             | the next sibling of the current selection
`.nextAll()`          | all subsequent siblings of the current selection
`.prev`               | the previous sibling of the current selection
`.prevAll()`          | all previous siblings of the current selection
`.filter()`           | finds elements in the matched set that in turn match the second selector
`.not()`, `:not()`    | find elements that do not match. Can be used in two ways, for example these two are equivalent: `$('li').not(.hot).addClass('cool');` and `$('li:not(.hot)').addClass('cool');`
`.has()`, `:has()`    | finds elements from the set that have a descendant that matches the selector
`.is()`               | checks whether the current selection matches a condition (returns a boolean)
`:contains()`         | selects elements from the set that contain the specified case sensitive text e.g. `$('li:contains(apples)').css('background', 'tomato');`
`.eq()`               | selects the element that matches the index number specified
`.lt()`               | selects the elements with an index less than the number specified
`.gt()`               | selects the elements with an index greater than the number specified


### Methods for getting/updating dimensions & positions
method                | description
------                | -----------
`.height()`           | the height of a box (no margin, border, padding)
`.width()`            | the width of a box (no margin, border, padding)
`.innerHeight()`      | the height of a box with padding
`.innerWidth()`       | the width of a box with padding
`.outerHeight()`      | the height of a box with padding and border
`.outerWidth()`       | the width of a box with padding and border
`.outerHeight(true)`  | the height of a box with padding, border and margin
`.outerWidth(true)`   | the width of a box with padding, border and margin
`$(document).height()`| the height of the entire html document
`$(document).width()` | the width of the entire html document
`$(window).height()`  | the height of the browser window
`$(window).width()`   | the width of the browser window
`.offset()`           | gets or sets coordinates of the element relative to the top left corner or the document object
`.position()`         | gets or sets coordinates of the element relative any ancestor that has been taken out of the normal flow with css box offsets. If no ancestor is found out of normal flow, it will return the same as `offset()`
`.scrollLeft()`       | gets the horizontal position of the scroll bar for the first element, or sets it for all matched nodes.
`.scrollTop()`        | gets the vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element, or sets it for all matched nodes


### Methods for effects & animation
method                | description
------                | -----------
`.show()`             | displays the selected elements
`.hide()`             | hides the selected elements
`.toggle()`           | toggles between showing and hiding
`.fadeIn()`           | fades in the selected elements
`.fadeOut()`          | fades out the selected elements
`.fadeTo()`           | changes opacity of selected elements
`.fadeToggle()`       | toggles fade in/out of selected element
`.slideDown()`        | shows the selected elements in a sliding motion
`.slideUp()`          | hides the selected elements in a sliding motion
`.slideToggle()`      | toggles the slideUp/SlideDown
`.delay()`            | delays the execution of subsequent methods
`.stop()`             | stops an animation if it is currently running. Pass `true` to this method to remove the queued animation.
`.animate()`          | creates custom animations of css properties


### Methods for creating event listeners
method                | description
------                | -----------
`.ready()`            | checks that the DOM tree has been constructed before running code. This isn't needed if your `<script>` included the `defer` attribute, or is located just before the closing `</body>`.
`.on()`               | used to handle all events. It needs two parameters, the even to respond to, and the code to run when the event occurs (passed as an anonymous or named function). Multiple events can be passed and are separated by a space. See [here for a complete list of web events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).


### Methods for looping
method                | description
------                | -----------
`.each()`             | allows you to loop through all the elements in a selection. The parameter given to each is a function. This function will usually use the `this` keyword like `$(this)` to target the current element node in the loop.


## Things to remember


### functions as parameters

This may be obvious but, methods that typically take a string or variable as a parameter, can also take a function that returns a string. For example:

```javascript
$('li').html(function () {
  return `<em>${$(this).text()}</em>`
});
```


### creating new elements to add to the DOM

There are a couple of ways to create new elements, for example:

```javascript
let $newEmptyElement = $('<li>');  // creates a new empty <li></li> element
let $newElement = $('<li class="priority">item</li>')

$('ul').append($newEmptyElement);
```


### adding css properties to elements

Note that you can add multiple css properties in the same method. To do so, pass an object literal. For example:

```javascript
$('#test').css({
  'padding-left': '25px',
  'font-weight': 300,
  'background': 'honeydew'
});
```


### .ready()

The ready() function which is helpful if your script is placed somewhere where it may run before the page has loaded.

```javascript
$(document).ready(function () {
    // don't run this code until the DOM tree is complete
});
```

Because this is such a common thing to do in jQuery, the above can be written as shorthand:

```javascript
$(function () {
    // don't run this code until the DOM tree is complete
});
```

As a side not, wrapping your code in the above, also prevents naming collisions since all your variables are contained in the function's scope.


### .each()

The `.each()` method lets you loop through each element in a selection and perform multiple actions by passing a function. You can use `this` to reference the current element node and its attributes or `$(this)` to create a jQuery object of the current element (which you will need if you want to apply jQuery methods). For example:

```javascript
$('li').each(function () {
  let html = $(this).html();
  console.log(html, this.id);
  // etc
});
```


### .on()

The `.on()` method requires two parameters but can take up to four: `.on(events[, selector][, data], function(e));`.

You can respond to multiple events by providing a space-separated list:

```javascript
$('li.todo').on('click touchstart', function () {
    // do something
})
```

You can respond to only a subset of the *direct descendants* of the initial jQuery selection by passing the optional selector parameter after the event and before the function. The following event will be triggered when anything inside the `ul` is clicked except those with the hot class.

```javascript
$('ul').on('click', ':not(.hot)', function () {
  // do something
});
```

You can pass additional information to the function that's called when the event is triggered by including the optional data parameter after the optional selector and before the function. Just like in vanilla js, the function is automatically passed the event object as a parameter but if you want to use it, or pass data, you should give it a name like `e`.

```javascript
$('ul').on('click', {status: 'important'}, function (e) {
  console.log(e.data.status);
});
```


### .animate()

You can animate any css property whose value can be represented as a number, e.g. `height`, `width`, `font-size`, etc. The `.animate()` method requires one parameter, an object literal of the properties: values to animate, but can take up to four parameters: `.animate(properties[, duration][, easing][, complete]);`.

Note that css properties are written in camelCase. Easing values can be "linear" or "swing". The complete parameter is a callback function that will run when the animation completes. For example:

```javascript
// animate without optional parameters
$('li').on('click', function () {
  $(this).animate({opacity: 0, marginLeft: '200px', fontSize: '.5rem'});
});

// animate with optional parameters
$('li').on('click', function () {
  $(this).animate({
    opacity: 0,
    marginLeft: '200px',
    fontSize: '.5rem'
  }, 500, 'swing', function () {
    $(this).remove();
  });
});
```


### .add()

At first, this method may seem redundant since you can include more than one selector in your initial jQuery selection, but this method allows us to do some different things in terms of chaining methods:

```javascript
// This makes both div and p have a background but only div has a border
$('div').css('border', '2px solid red')
  .add('p')
  .css('background', 'yellow');
```

You're also not limited to passing a css-style selector string to `add()`. You can also pass: a jquery selection, an html string, or another selector. For example:

```javascript
$('div.info').add($('ul:has(li.important)')).css('background', 'yellow');

$('li').add('<p id="new">new paragraph</p>')
  .css('background-color', 'red');

$('p').add(document.getElementById('test')).css('background', 'yellow');
```


### .scrollTop()

When the heading is clicked, the page will scroll to 125px from the top;

```javascript
$('h1').on('click', function () {
  $(document).scrollTop(125);
});
```


### .offset() and .position()

These two methods return an object with properties left and top:

```javascript
let offset = $('h2').offset();
console.log(`top: ${offset.top}, left: ${offset.left}`);
// top: 120.38333129882812, left: 8
```

If you want to set the offset, pass an object literal:
```javascript
$('h2').offset({top: 200, left: 200});
// produces:
// <h2 style="position: relative; top: 79.6167px; left: 192px;">Testing</h2>
```

When you do this, the jQuery will set the element(s) to `position: relative` and calculate `top` and `left` properties so that the final offset results in what was requested.
