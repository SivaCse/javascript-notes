# javascript notes

## description
In the same spirit as [my python notes](https://github.com/jessicarush/python-notes), I'll be using this repo to collect my notes and example code as I learn JavaScript. Filenames reflect the topic as much as possible. The data directory contains resources for some of the examples. My training is self-guided through the use of text books and online resources listed below.

## credits
Some examples and notes come from the following:

- 'JavaScript: The Good Parts' - *Douglas Crockford*  
- 'You Don't Know JavaScript' - *Kyle Simpson*  


A very special thanks to [aleph2c](https://github.com/aleph2c) for so, so, much support. Check out his epic [statechart library; Miros here](https://aleph2c.github.io/miros/index.html).
